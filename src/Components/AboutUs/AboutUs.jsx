He took an office in Dhanmondi, the commercial region of Dhaka, and started to provide training, services and support in several segments of information and technology, especially in Web Development, Web Design, Digital Marketing and Branding.
                    </p>

                        The Government of Bangladesh has announced the digitalization of the country under the government project named "Digital Bangladesh by 2021.”
                    </p>
                    <p className=' mt-3'>
                        The project has main two aims, one is to reach the facilities of information and technology to every person in the country and another goal is to make skilled human resources so that they can engage themselves with every spare technology.
                    </p>
                    <p className=' mt-3'>
                        Bangladesh turns into a developed country within “ Vision 2041”. To make the project successful, the Government gives priority to the Non-Governed sectors.
                    </p>
                    <p className=' mt-3'>
                        The main visions of Topitltd are to provide the best training, services and support for information and technology. As Bangladesh is going to digitize every sector from top to bottom, the government and non-government sectors need employees who have the best skills in information and technology.
                    </p>
                    <p className=' mt-3'>
                        But most of the job seekers in the country don’t have enough skills. As a result, the number of unemployed people is increasing day by day. The problem of unemployment will be reduced gradually if the job seekers are well trained in information and technology.
                    </p>
                    <p className=' mt-3'>
                        To create skilled human resources and contribute to the national economy the Topitltd is working restlessly.
